This article will cover the SAT test pattern, its relevance for further studies, and the costs associated with taking the exam.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the SAT Test Pattern</h2>
    <p>The SAT measures your knowledge and skills in areas crucial for academic success in college. It consists of two main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math, with an optional Essay section. Here’s a breakdown of each section:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">1. Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW):</span> This section is divided into two tests:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Reading Test (65 minutes):</span> This test consists of 52 multiple-choice questions based on passages from literature, historical documents, social sciences, and natural sciences. You'll need to read and analyze these passages to answer the questions.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Writing and Language Test (35 minutes):</span> This test includes 44 multiple-choice questions that require you to read passages and identify and correct errors in grammar, usage, and punctuation.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">2. Math:</span> The Math section is divided into two parts:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Math Test - No Calculator (25 minutes):</span> This part has 20 questions, including multiple-choice and grid-in questions that test arithmetic, algebra, and some advanced math concepts.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Math Test - Calculator (55 minutes):</span> This part includes 38 questions that test more advanced math concepts, including problem-solving and data analysis.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">3. Optional Essay (50 minutes):</span> This section requires you to read a passage and write an essay analyzing how the author builds an argument to persuade the audience. Although optional, some colleges require the essay for admission.</p>

    <h2>Relevance of SAT for Further Studies</h2>
