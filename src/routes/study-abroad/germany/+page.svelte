    <h2>Requirements for Nepali Students</h2>

    <ol>

            studies and a bachelor's degree for postgraduate programs.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>German Language Proficiency:</strong> While many programs are
            offered in English, proficiency in German may be required, especially
