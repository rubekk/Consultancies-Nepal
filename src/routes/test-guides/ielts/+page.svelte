  <p>
    The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) is a popular
    English proficiency test recognized by universities, employers, and
    governments worldwide. It assesses your English skills in Listening,
    Reading, Writing, and Speaking. There are two versions: Academic for higher
    education and General Training for work or migration. IELTS is trusted for
    its accurate assessment and is a great option for those planning to study,
    work, or move to English-speaking countries.
