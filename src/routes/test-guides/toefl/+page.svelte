    <img src={toeflImg} alt="TOEFL Image">
    <p>The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is a standardized test that measures English language proficiency for non-native speakers. It's widely accepted by universities, employers, and immigration authorities worldwide. This article will cover the TOEFL test pattern, its relevance for further studies, and the costs associated with taking the exam.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the TOEFL Test Pattern</h2>
    <p>The TOEFL test evaluates your ability to use and understand English at the university level. It measures your reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills in an academic context. Here’s a breakdown of each section:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">1. Reading (60-80 minutes):</span> This section consists of 3-4 passages, each approximately 700 words long, with 10 questions per passage. You'll need to read and understand these passages to answer the questions.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">2. Listening (60-90 minutes):</span> This section includes 4-6 lectures (each 3-5 minutes long) and 2-3 conversations (each 3 minutes long), with a total of 34-51 questions. You will answer questions based on the content and intent of the spoken material.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">3. Speaking (20 minutes):</span> The speaking section has 6 tasks. Two tasks ask you to express an opinion on a familiar topic, and four tasks require you to speak based on reading and listening tasks. Your responses are recorded and sent to the ETS for scoring.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">4. Writing (50 minutes):</span> The writing section consists of two tasks. The first task is integrated and requires you to read a passage, listen to a short lecture, and then write a summary and comparison of the two. The second task is independent and asks you to write an essay on a given topic.</p>

    <h2>Relevance of TOEFL for Further Studies</h2>
    <p>The TOEFL is essential for students aiming to study in an English-speaking country or an English-medium program. Here’s why:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">1. University Admission:</span> Many universities and colleges require TOEFL scores as part of their admission process. A strong TOEFL score demonstrates your ability to succeed in an English-speaking academic environment.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">2. Visa Requirements:</span> For many countries, a TOEFL score is a mandatory part of the student visa application process. It assures immigration authorities that you have the necessary language skills to live and study in their country.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">3. Scholarships:</span> High TOEFL scores can qualify you for scholarships and financial aid. Many institutions and organizations consider English proficiency when awarding scholarships.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">4. Course Placement:</span> Some institutions use TOEFL scores to place students in appropriate courses or levels of study. A higher score might exempt you from certain language courses, saving you time and money.</p>

    <h2>Cost of Taking the TOEFL Exam</h2>
    <p>The cost of the TOEFL exam can vary depending on the country and test center where you take the test. Here’s a breakdown of the typical costs:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">1. Standard Test Fee:</span> The fee for the TOEFL iBT (Internet-Based Test) ranges between $180 to $250, depending on your location. This cost includes the entire test process and the issuance of your test results.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">2. Additional Costs:</span> There are additional fees for various services:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Late Registration:</span> If you register after the regular deadline, a late registration fee of $40 applies.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Rescheduling:</span> Changing your test date incurs a fee of $60.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Score Reports:</span> The TOEFL fee includes sending your scores to up to four institutions. Additional score reports cost $20 each.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">3. Preparation Costs:</span> While not part of the exam fee, consider the cost of preparation materials and courses. Investing in TOEFL preparation books, online courses, and practice tests can significantly enhance your chances of achieving a high score.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The TOEFL exam is a crucial step for anyone aiming to study, work, or migrate to an English-speaking country. Understanding the test pattern can help you prepare effectively, and being aware of the costs ensures you can budget accordingly. A strong TOEFL score not only enhances your chances of university admission but also plays a vital role in securing visas and scholarships. Investing time and resources in preparing for the TOEFL can pave the way for countless opportunities in your academic and professional journey.</p>
